# Dominoes

## Getting Started

This application is written in **Java** and uses no external dependencies in the application code.
It has a two 3rd party dependencies to ease unit testing.
Namely, 
- junit
- junit-benchmarks

Dependencies are managed through Gradle, and will be downloaded automatically when a build is run.

To run the application you will need the following:
1. JDK 15.0.1 (Java 15)
2. Gradle 6.7 (Wrapper Included)

You can build the application from source, or use the bundled JAR file (`./bin/app.jar`), provided you have a recent JRE installed on your machine.

### Building from source

To build from source, execute the following Gradle Wrapper command from your terminal (or IDE), which will download the Gradle binaries, and create the (executable) JAR file.
(Note: This command will also run the test cases that are part of the application!)
```
mshiv@LAPTOP-ENNNEGDS MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Development/assessments/dominoes (main)
$ ./gradlew build

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 7.0.
Use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings.
See https://docs.gradle.org/6.7/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4s
7 actionable tasks: 7 executed
```

After you've built the application, simply run the JAR with the following command, and you should see similar output!

```

### Using the bundled JAR

It is recommended to build from source, however, if that is not possible - a precompiled JAR is provided.

Run the following command from your terminal in the root project directory.

`java -jar ./bin/app.jar`

This should run the application in exactly the same way as above.
